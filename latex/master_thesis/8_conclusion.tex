\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Data generated by a GAN, may it be a cGAN or a MADGAN, may not fully capturethe distribution characteristics of its training data. Though, generated images do visually appear realistic, they may only partially reflect the statistical characteristics of the original data. This can lead to synthetic images that appear \textit{good} to a human inspector, but may contain amounts of noice that may interfere with a subsequent classifier.
