\section{Theoretical Background}\label{body_theoretical_background}
This chapter serves as a reference for theoretical background necessary, to understand the insights gained in the following experiments chapter. The first section will discuss the backgrounds for Data Augmentation (DA) and generative data augmentation (GDA). The second major section introduces the background for GANs. Starting with the vanilla version by Goodfellow et al., traversing the next evolution over deep conventional GANs, followed by conditional GANs and ultimately, introducting the theoretical background for MADGANs. Also included in the section for GAN background is the mandatory knowledge for the Inception Score and the Fr√©chet Inception Distance. The last section in this chapter will examine the backgrounds for the classifiers used, that are trained on the datasets, exanded by the before generated images.
