\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks} (GANs) \cite{goodfellow2014generativeadversarialnetworks} and their variants revolutionized the field of computer vision in the year of 2014, enabling advacements in multiple areas of generating data. From \textit{Text to Image Synthesis} \cite{reed2016generativeadversarialtextimage}, \textit{Image Translation} \cite{isola2018imagetoimagetranslationconditionaladversarial}, \textit{Super Resolution} \cite{ledig2017photorealisticsingleimagesuperresolution}, \textit{Image Inpainting} \cite{pathak2016contextencodersfeaturelearning}, \textit{Style Transfer} \cite{wang2023multimodalityguidedimagestyletransfer} to \textit{Data Augmentation} \cite{shorten2019survey}, GANs have been used in a variety of applications.

The idea of using GANs for \textit{Generative Data Augmentation} (GDA) has already been applied sucessfully, e.g.: in computer vision \cite{Li2025comprehensivesurvedeepimages}, \cite{biswas2023generativeadversarialnetworksdata} or for creating music \cite{ji2020comprehensivesurveydeepmusic}. Especially the former survey \textit{A Comprehensive Survey of Image Generation Models Based on Deep Learning} has, along \textit{Variational Auto Encoders} (VAEs), a dedicated focus on GANs. Despite these achievements, in practice, GANs suffer from several challenges, complicating the training and inference process:

\begin{itemize}\label{problems_of_gans}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
    \item Mode Collapse
    \item Loss of inter-class Diversity
    \item Failure to Converge
    \item Vanishing Gradiants \& Unstable Gradiants
    \item Imbalance between Generator- and Discriminator Model
\end{itemize}


This thesis investigates the potential of using GANs - specifically \textit{Multi-Agent Diverse Generative Adversarial Networks} (MADGANs) \cite{ghosh2018multiagentdiversegenerativeadversarial} - for Generative Data Augmentation. MADGANs aim to aid the first two of the afore mentioned in particular: Mode Collapse and Loss of inter-class Diversity. They, along other modifications, "\textit{propose to modify the objective function of the discriminator, in which, along with finding the real and the fake samples, the discriminator also has to correctly predict the generator that generated the given fake sample.}" \cite{ghosh2018multiagentdiversegenerativeadversarial}. The goal of this adjustment of the discriminator is, that the discriminator has to push the generators towards distinct identifiable modes. While various strategies have been proposed to addrese mode collapse and inter-class diversity MADGANs explicitly enfocre mode seperation by introduction of multiple generators and the adjusted discriminator objective. This makes them particularly promising for GDA, as diverse samples and clear distinction of modes is crucial for training robust classifiers. In their paper, they experimentally show, that their architectural adjustment of GANs is generally capable of giving providing assistance for the first two of the mentioned problems.

The experiments in this work are structured into three major parts.

\paragraph{Set 1: Training and Analysis of GANs}  \label{thesis_goal_1}
The first set trains and analyses GANs, explicitly MADGANs and \textit{Conditional GANs} (cGANs). Here, the quality of the resulting images during training will be scored by the \textit{Fréchet Inception Distance} (FID) \cite{heusel2018ganstrainedtimescaleupdate} and the \textit{Inception Score} (IS) \cite{salimans2016improvedtechniquestraininggans}.

\paragraph{Set 2: Generating and Classifying Unlabeled Images}  \label{thesis_goal_2}
The second set uses the afore trained generative models to create images. Images without labels—images originating from MADGANs—will be classified using auxiliary classifiers trained with traditional data augmentation techniques.

\paragraph{Set 3: Training and Evaluating Classifiers}  \label{thesis_goal_3}
The third and most significant set of experiments trains classifiers using the generated data. For this, stratified classifiers with differing numbers of real and fake images are trained and evaluated on the respective validation set. Their classification performance will be assessed using standard metrics.
\footnote{The set of metrics used to assess the quality of the resulting classifiers is defined in chapter Experiments Setup \ref{body_experiments_setup}.}
\\

\noindent All of the above described is executed on the following datasets:
\begin{itemize}\label{used_datasets}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
    \item MNIST \cite{lecun2010mnist}
    \item Fashion MNIST \cite{xiao2017fashionmnist}
    \item CIFAR10 \cite{Krizhevsky2009learning}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Aim of the Thesis}\label{aim_of_the_thesis}
This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of Multi-Agent Diverse GANs for Generative Data Augmentation. First, the quality of their generated samples is compared to those produced by a Conditional GAN. Next, both sets of generated images are used to augment training datasets for classifiers, which are then assessed on their respective test sets. Classifiers trained on cGAN-augmented data and those trained with traditional augmentation techniques — such as flipping, rotation, and noise addition — serve as baselines for comparison.
By doing so, this study examines the impact of MADGAN-based augmentation on classifier performance, highlighting its advantages and limitations relative to conventional methods and cGAN-based augmentation.
