\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Data generated by a GAN, may it be a cGAN or a MADGAN, may not fully capturethe distribution characteristics of its training data. Though, generated images do visually appear realistic, they may only partially reflect the statistical characteristics of the original data. This can lead to synthetic images that appear \textit{good} to a human inspector, but may contain amounts of noice that may interfere with a subsequent classifier.

%% Goood answer:
from an information theoratival standpoint, a generative model G trained on data X, distilling knowledge into a classifier C should not offer more information that what was already present in X.

Future research could focus on directly evaluating the impact of using MAD-GAN generated samples for augmenting various image classification datasets across different domains and comparing the resulting performance gains with those achieved by traditional and other generative augmentation techniques. Exploring methods to exert more control over the types of variations generated by MAD-GAN to specifically target weaknesses or improve the robustness of classifiers against particular types of noise or adversarial attacks would also be a valuable direction. Additionally, investigating the computational efficiency and scalability of training MAD-GAN for very large and complex datasets in the context of practical data augmentation pipelines would be crucial for its wider adoption. Finally, exploring the applicability of the MAD-GAN framework to generate diverse augmented data for other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, as well as for other data modalities such as natural language processing or audio processing, could further broaden its impact. The work by Ghosh et al. on Multi-Agent Diverse GANs represents a promising step towards leveraging the power of generative models for more effective and robust data augmentation in image classification and beyond.


after all, we tested an augmentation technique and maybe it should be treated as such. Augmentations should be drawn from a number of different techniques. Braughtly speaking, across different domains, types of classifiers, etc. there might not be a single best kind of augmentation technique. Ultimately, this is an optimization problem in and of itself and can and should be treated as such.
